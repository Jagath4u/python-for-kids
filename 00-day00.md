# Day 0 - Setting up the Laptop/Desktop

Course requires a very simple setup. There are two important to which will be used during this course,

- Microsoft Teams (only for online class)
- Python runtime

However, the **MS Teams** and **Python** installation are optional because you can use them from Browser. For Microsoft teams when you launch it, it asks whether you want to use the installed application or continue with the browser. So if you do not have an app installed you can join the team by having your browser up and running.  

For some reason if you cannot install Python in your machine, which I highly recommend then you can also use it from your browser. I say, install it. This will not take a lot of space in your machine and will give you some peace of mind.  

Here are the instructions given for the setup in both Windows operating systems and Linux based operating systems like Ubuntu.

## How you can install Python
