# Day 10 - Collections

In **Python** we have few data types for **collections**,

- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set

> This is important to understand and remember before we dive into Loop

Sometimes these kind of collections are also known as **array**. So if you hear the term **array** then it means a kind of collection.

## List

```python
# List (ordered and changeable) [allow duplocate]
theList = ["cycle", "scooter", "car"]
print(theList)
print(type(theList)) #<class 'list'>
```

## Tuple

```python
# Tuple (ordered and unchangeable) [allow duplicate]
theTuple = ("cycle", "scooter", "car")
print(theTuple)
print(type(theTuple)) #<class 'tuple'>
```

## Set

```python
# Set (unordered and unindexed) [NO duplicate]
theSet = {"cycle", "scooter", "car"}
print(theSet)
print(type(theSet)) #<class 'set'>
```

## Dictionary

```python
# Dictionary (unordered, changeable and indexed) [NO duplicate]
theDictionary = {
    "1": "Wriju",
    "2": "Wrishika",
    "3": "Writam"
}
print(theDictionary)
print(type(theDictionary)) #<class 'dict'>
```
