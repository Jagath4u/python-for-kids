# Reading from a File

Like writing to a file reading from a file also can be done in many different ways. Let's discuss few.

If a file contains only one line then this can be as simple as

```python
filename = "C:\\temp\\myfile.txt"
f=open(filename,"r")

line = f.readline()
print(line)

f.close()
```

> If the file is multiline then it would read only the first line.

<!-- > If the file does not exists then it would through an error. Howerver, you can avoid this situation by using `w+` option, this would open the file for read and write mode. In write mode we know the file gets created if it does not exists.  
>
> The best option is to use `a+` that way there is no chance to overwite the old file as well as the new file would be created if not exists. -->

## Read a file line by line

When you have multiple lines in a file then you can take one of the approaches,

```python
filename = "C:\\temp\\myfile.txt"
f=open(filename,"r")

for line in f:
    print(line)
f.close()
```

Reading file line by line using `while` loop

```python
line = f.readline()
while line != '':
    print(line)
    line = f.readline()
```

Readine file line by line using `for` loop

```python
lines = f.readlines()
for line in lines:
    print(line)
```

Reading everything together,

```python
lines = f.read()
print(lines)
```
