# Graphics with Turtle

Playing with **Turtle** helps learner many different powerful features of programming language through fun.

**Turtle** is part of default Python library. It is now inside already. You just need to import it.

```python
import turtle
```

**Turtle** is initialized in your screen left to right horzontally. Which means if you call `forward()` it will move horizontally left to right.

```python
turtle.forward(100)
```

```python
import turtle

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90) #will take 90 degree right turn
turtle.forward(100)

turtle.done() #by calling this the popup window will stay
```

## Square

To draw a *square* you can use the below code

```python
import turtle

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90) #will take 90 degree right turn

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)

#by calling this the popup window will stay
turtle.done()
```

Because we are rpeating the same set four times, we can use loop instead.

```python
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.right(90)
```

Using loop for drawing square,

```python
import turtle

for i in range(4):
    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.right(90)

turtle.done()
```

## Rectangle

```python
import turtle

for i in range(2):
    turtle.forward(200)
    turtle.right(90)

    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.right(90)

turtle.done()
```

## Circle

```python
import turtle

turtle.circle(120)

turtle.done()
```

## Color

You can change the color of the line and fill them inside,

```python
import turtle
turtle.color("red", "yellow")

turtle.begin_fill()
turtle.circle(120)
turtle.end_fill()

turtle.done()
```

The output would look like
