# Day 28 - Find Smallest and Largest number(s) from a collection

If you have a collection and you need to find the top one or few largest numbers or bottom one or few smallest numbers then you can use `heapq`

```python
import heapq 

#Find top Large/bottom small numbers
nums = [1,3,4,6,8,9,22,44]

#Find top 3 largest numbers
topThree = heapq.nlargest(3, nums)
print("Three Largest..")
print(topThree)

print("")

#Find bottom 2 smallest numbers
smallTwo = heapq.nsmallest(2, nums)
print("Two Smallest..")
print(smallTwo)
```

If the list is complex, say each element contains multiple values as below where we have list of students and their weights. To find the heaviest students,

```python
import heapq

students = [
    {'name':'Student1', 'weight':33.5},
    {'name':'Student2', 'weight':36},
    {'name':'Student3', 'weight':35},
    {'name':'Student4', 'weight':53.5},
    {'name':'Student5', 'weight':43.5}
]

heavyStudent = heapq.nlargest(1, students, key= lambda s : s['weight'])
print(heavyStudent)

```
