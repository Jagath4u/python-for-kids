# Day 12 - Loop - While

`while` loop is similar to `for` loop which we have discussed [here](11-day11.md). However, they have some sytactical differences and internal workings. It is a simple form of loop in Python.

We will not focus on the internals but see how the syntax looks like,

## Simple while loop

Notice here the number has to be incremented by you. Here we are using `n+=1` which means `n=n+1`. Thus the next `n` will be `+1` of the previous.

```python
n = 1
while n < 11:
    print(n)
    n+=1
```

## Using 3rd variable to terminate the loop

By changing an `True` value of a `boolean` data type checking until it is `True` loop it.

```python
i = 1
blnFlag = True
while blnFlag:
    print(i)
    if(i == 10):
        blnFlag = False
    i+=1
```

## Using break keyword to terminate

You can use `break` to come out of the `while` loop as needed. No need to use any other `boolean` value to do so.  

```python
j = 1
while (j < 10):
    if(j == 5):
        break
    else:
        print(j)
    j+=1
```

In below example it will look for the value `9` and if it is not the case it won't do anything by using `pass` keyword. Pass is a statement to simply do nothing.

```python
k = 1
while (k<10):
    if k != 9:
        pass
    else:
        print(k)
    k +=1
```

The [code](SampleCode/13Function.py) is available.
