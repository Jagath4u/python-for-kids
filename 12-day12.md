# Day 12 - Loop - While

`while` loop is similar to `for` loop which we have discussed [here](11-day11.md). However, they have some sytactical differences and internal workings. We will not focus on the internals but see how the syntax looks like,

## Simple while loop

```python
n = 1
while n < 11:
    print(n)
    n+=1
```

## Using 3rd variable to terminate the loop

```python
i = 1
blnFlag = True
while blnFlag:
    print(i)
    if(i == 10):
        blnFlag = False
    i+=1
```

## Using break keyword to terminate

```python
j = 1
while (j < 10):
    if(j == 5):
        break
    else:
        print(j)
    j+=1
```
